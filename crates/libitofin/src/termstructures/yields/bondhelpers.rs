//! Bond rate helpers for the yield-curve bootstrap.
//!
//! Port of `ql/termstructures/yield/bondhelpers.{hpp,cpp}`: [`BondHelper`], a
//! bootstrap helper that fits a bond's quoted clean or dirty price, and
//! [`FixedRateBondHelper`], the fixed-coupon constructor over it.
//!
//! Unlike the schedule-derived helpers of
//! [`ratehelpers`](super::ratehelpers), a bond helper is a *fixed*-date helper
//! (the C++ `BondHelper : public RateHelper`, not a `RelativeDateRateHelper`):
//! its bond and its dates are built once, and the hpp warns that "the reference
//! date does not change between calls of `setTermStructure()`". So it uses
//! [`BootstrapHelperBase::new`] and does not observe the evaluation date.
//!
//! The C++ ctor clones the passed bond (`ext::make_shared<Bond>(*bond)`) so the
//! helper has sole ownership of it, guarding against external pricing-engine
//! installs corrupting the bootstrap. This port takes the [`Bond`] by value:
//! the move gives the same sole ownership structurally, with no clone.
//!
//! [`CPIBondHelper`](https://www.quantlib.org) (`bondhelpers.cpp:116`) is not
//! ported: the inflation sibling needs the CPI-bond machinery, which is not on
//! main. The C++ `accept`/`AcyclicVisitor` hooks are dropped, as on every other
//! helper.
