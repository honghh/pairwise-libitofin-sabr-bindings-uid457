//! Dated events.
//!
//! Port of `ql/event.hpp`: the base class for anything that happens on a date
//! and can say whether it has already happened.
//! [`CashFlow`](crate::cashflow::CashFlow) is its main specialization.
//!
//! [`has_occurred`](Event::has_occurred) diverges from the C++ base class in
//! taking the [`Settings`] explicitly (D5) and returning [`QlResult`]: an unset
//! evaluation date is an error here rather than a silent fall back to the
//! system clock (D10). It is also a *required* method rather than a virtual one
//! with a base implementation: C++ lets `CashFlow` override the base rule, and
//! Rust has no specialization, so an inherited default would silently give a
//! cash flow the plain-event rule. Implementors forward to
//! [`event_has_occurred`] instead. The `accept(AcyclicVisitor&)` override and
//! the `detail::simple_event` placeholder have no counterpart in the port.
