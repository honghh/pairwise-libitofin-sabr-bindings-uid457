//! The stepping contract a finite-difference model drives.
//!
//! C++ has no scheme base class: `FiniteDifferenceModel` is a template over
//! the evolver (`finitedifferencemodel.hpp:37`) and reaches `setStep` and
//! `step` through the type parameter. The model of #658 dispatches instead, so
//! the two methods every scheme already carries become a trait here.
