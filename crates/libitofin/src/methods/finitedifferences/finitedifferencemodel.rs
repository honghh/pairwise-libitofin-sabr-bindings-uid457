//!
//! - the operator-taking constructor (`hpp:45-52`), which builds the evolver
//!   from an operator and a boundary-condition set. That needs every scheme to
//!   share one constructor signature, which the [`Scheme`] trait does not carry
//!   and no caller wants: `FdmBackwardSolver` builds its scheme first and hands
//!   it over (`fdmbackwardsolver.cpp:101-103`);
//! - the `evolver()` accessor (`hpp:62`), which nothing in C++ or here reads;
//! - the no-condition `rollback` overload (`hpp:67-72`). C++ has two that
//!   differ only in passing a null `condition_type*` down to `rollbackImpl`
//!   (`hpp:71`); the one method here takes the [`Option`] that pointer is.
