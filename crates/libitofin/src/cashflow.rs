//! Cash flows.
//!
//! Port of `ql/cashflow.hpp`: an [`Event`] that pays an [`amount`](CashFlow::amount),
//! and [`Leg`], the ordered sequence of them. The concrete flows follow in
//! `cashflows/`, mirroring `ql/cashflows/`.
//!
//! `CashFlow` inherits `LazyObject` in C++ purely so that `Coupon` can cache -
//! `performCalculations()` on the base is empty - so the port leaves the
//! caching to the concrete flows that need it. The `accept(AcyclicVisitor&)`
//! override and the `earlier_than<CashFlow>` comparator have no counterpart in
//! the port. The `isCoupon`/`coupon_cast` downcast pair does:
//! [`CashFlow::as_coupon`].
