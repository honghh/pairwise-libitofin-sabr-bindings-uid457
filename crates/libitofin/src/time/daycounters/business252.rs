//! Business/252 day count convention.
//!
//! Port of `ql/time/daycounters/business252.{hpp,cpp}`. Counts business days on
//! a given calendar and divides by 252, the conventional number of business
//! days in a Brazilian year. Defaults to the Brazil (settlement) calendar.
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! QuantLib memoizes per-month and per-year business-day totals in
//! process-global `std::map`s keyed by calendar name, then stitches a day count
//! together from those cached figures. That global mutable state conflicts with
//! this port's "explicit state, no hidden singletons" decision (D5), the same
//! reason [`Calendar`] holiday overrides are
//! per-value here. This port drops the cache and counts directly with
//! [`Calendar::business_days_between`] (first day included, last excluded).
//!
//! For a calendar with its built-in schedule the two agree exactly: QuantLib's
//! month/year decomposition is a pure caching optimization whose contiguous
//! `[include-first, exclude-last]` segments telescope back to a single
//! `businessDaysBetween(d1, d2)`. They can diverge once holidays are
//! *overridden*, though: QuantLib populates each cached figure once and keys it
//! only by calendar name, so an `addHoliday`/`removeHoliday` after the first
//! query leaves the cache stale, while this port always reflects the current
//! holiday set. In that case the direct count is the more correct of the two.
