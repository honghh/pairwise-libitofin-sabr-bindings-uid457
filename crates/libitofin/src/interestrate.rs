//! Interest-rate compounding algebra.
//!
//! Port of `ql/compounding.hpp` and `ql/interestrate.{hpp,cpp}`: the
//! [`Compounding`] conventions and the [`InterestRate`] class, which bundles a
//! rate with its day-counting and compounding conventions and converts between
//! them (discount/compound factors, implied and equivalent rates).
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! - QuantLib's default constructor builds a *null* interest rate
//!   (`Null<Rate>`), rejected at use time by `compoundFactor`. The null state
//!   is not ported: an [`InterestRate`] always holds an actual rate, and call
//!   sites that need "not yet set" use `Option<InterestRate>` (same approach
//!   as the always-valid [`DayCounter`]).
//! - Constructor and conversion preconditions (`QL_REQUIRE`) surface as
//!   [`QlResult`] per D4 instead of exceptions.
//! - QuantLib lets `compoundFactor` return non-positive (or, for compounded
//!   conventions with `1 + r/f <= 0`, NaN) factors, which turn into infinite
//!   or negative discount factors downstream. Since this API is already
//!   fallible, such out-of-domain inputs are rejected instead: simple factors
//!   `1 + r t <= 0` and compounding bases `1 + r/f <= 0` return an error.
